							<h4>Surgery<span>/</span></h4>
						</div>
						<p>Breast cancer surgery is a key component of breast cancer treatment that involves removing the cancer with an operation. Breast cancer surgery may be used alone or in combination with other treatments, such as chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy and radiation therapy.</p>
						<p>For people with a very high risk of breast cancer, breast cancer surgery may be an option to reduce the risk of future breast cancer. </p>

							<h4>Chemotherapy<span>/</span></h4>
						</div>
						<p>Chemotherapy for breast cancer uses drugs to target and destroy breast cancer cells. These drugs are usually injected directly into a vein through a needle or taken by mouth as pills.</p>
						<p>Chemotherapy for breast cancer frequently is used in addition to other treatments, such as surgery, radiation or hormone therapy. Chemotherapy can be used to increase the chance of a cure, decrease the risk of the cancer returning, alleviate symptoms from the cancer or help people with cancer live longer with a better quality of life.</p>
						<p>If the cancer has recurred or spread, chemotherapy may control the breast cancer to help you live longer. Or it can help ease symptoms the cancer is causing.</p>
						<p>Chemotherapy for breast cancer also carries a risk of side effects â€” some temporary and mild, others more serious or permanent. Your doctor can help you decide whether chemotherapy for breast cancer is a good choice for you.</p>

							<h4>Radiation Therapy<span>/</span></h4>
						</div>

						<p>Radiation therapy for breast cancer uses high-energy X-rays, protons or other particles to kill cancer cells. Rapidly growing cells, such as cancer cells, are more susceptible to the effects of radiation therapy than are normal cells.</p>
						<p>The X-rays or particles are painless and invisible. You are not radioactive after treatment, so it is safe to be around other people, including children.</p>
						<p>Radiation therapy for breast cancer may be delivered through:</p>
						<h4><span>External radiation</span></h4>
						<p>A machine delivers radiation from outside your body to the breast. This is the most common type of radiation therapy used for breast cancer.</p>
						<h4><span>Internal radiation (brachytherapy). </span></h4>
						<p>After you have surgery to remove the cancer, your doctor temporarily places a radiation-delivery device in your breast in the area where the cancer once was. A radioactive source is placed into the device for short periods of time over the course of your treatment.</p>
						<p>Radiation therapy may be used to treat breast cancer at almost every stage. Radiation therapy is an effective way to reduce your risk of breast cancer recurring after surgery. In addition, it is commonly used to ease the symptoms caused by cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic breast cancer).</p>
