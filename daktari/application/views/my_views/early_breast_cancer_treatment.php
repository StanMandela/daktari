						<h4>Sentinel Lymph node Biopsy <span>/</span></h4>
					</div>

					<p>Sentinel lymph node biopsy instead of axillary lymph node dissection to avoid lymphedemia </p>
					<p>Sentinel node biopsy is a surgical procedure used to determine whether cancer has spread beyond a primary tumor into your lymphatic system. It's used most commonly in evaluating breast cancer and melanoma. </p>

					<p>The sentinel nodes are the first few lymph nodes into which a tumor drains. Sentinel node biopsy involves injecting a tracer material that helps the surgeon locate the sentinel nodes during surgery. The sentinel nodes are removed and analyzed in a laboratory.</p>

					 <p>If the sentinel nodes are free of cancer, then cancer is unlikely to have spread, and removing additional lymph nodes is unnecessary.</p>

						<p>If a sentinel lymph node biopsy reveals cancer, your doctor might recommend removing more lymph nodes.</p>

						<h4>Breast Conservation Surgery <span>/</span></h4>

					<p>Surgery to remove cancer or other abnormal tissue from the breast and some normal tissue around it, but not the breast itself. Some lymph nodes under the arm may be removed for biopsy. Part of the chest wall lining may also be removed if the cancer is near it. Also called breast-sparing surgery, lumpectomy, partial mastectomy, quadrantectomy, and segmental mastectomy.</p>

						<h4>Axillary lymph node dissection <span>/</span></h4>
					</div>
<p>Long-term results from a large clinical trial confirm that, for some women with early-stage breast cancer who have lumpectomy as their surgical treatment, a less extensive lymph node biopsy approach is sufficient.

	The trial showed that women with early-stage breast cancer who have cancer cells in one or two sentinel lymph nodes can skip axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) after breast-conserving surgery without affecting their long-term survival.</p>

						<h4>Oncoplastic Surgery and reconstruction <span>/</span></h4>
					</div>
					<p>Oncoplastic lumpectomy combines plastic surgery techniques with lumpectomy to both remove the cancer and reconstruct and reshape the breast. It can be useful for achieving a good cosmetic outcome in many women who choose lumpectomy, such as those who have:</p>

					<li><ul>smaller breasts, where removing even a small tumor is likely to have a visible impact </ul>
					</li>
					<li><ul>breast cancer in an especially visible place, such as high on the chest wall, on the inner portion of the breast, or close to the nipple.</ul></li>
					<li><ul>mid- to large-sized breasts and the need to have a large amount of tissue (20% to 50%) removed from the affected breast.</ul></li>
					<li><ul>existing issues with their breasts, such as excessive sagging (ptosis), very large size (macromastia), or obvious lack of symmetry (balance), which could be addressed at the same time th e cancer is removed.</ul></li>

					<li><ul>chemotherapy before surgery (called neoadjuvant chemotherapy) that shrinks the cancer enough to make lumpectomy possible.</ul></li>
